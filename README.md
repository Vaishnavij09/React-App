# React Custom Hook - useFetch

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a custom React hook named `useFetch` to simplify API data fetching.

The `useFetch` hook accepts a URL as a parameter and handles:

- Fetching data from an API
- Managing loading state
- Handling errors

The hook returns:
- `data`
- `loading`
- `error`

A sample component uses this custom hook to fetch and display data from a dummy API.

This project highlights how custom hooks improve code reusability and maintainability in React applications.
